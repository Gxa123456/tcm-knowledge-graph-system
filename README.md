AI-powered Traditional Chinese Medicine Knowledge Graph system integrating Neo4j, LangChain, and local LLM with hybrid retrieval and Cypher auto-generation.
🏮 Intelligent TCM Knowledge Graph System

AI-powered Traditional Chinese Medicine Knowledge Graph integrating Neo4j, LangChain, vector embeddings, and hybrid retrieval.

📌 Overview

This project implements an end-to-end Intelligent Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Knowledge Graph System, combining:

Graph database modeling

Large Language Model (LLM) integration

Cypher auto-generation

Vector-based semantic retrieval

Streamlit-based interactive UI

The system enables users to query diseases, syndromes, and symptoms using natural language and receive structured graph-based answers.

🎯 Motivation

Traditional Chinese Medicine knowledge is:

Highly hierarchical

Rich in relational structure

Difficult to query using relational databases

This project transforms structured TCM knowledge into:

A graph-based medical knowledge base

An AI-powered QA system

A hybrid structured + semantic retrieval engine
